# React TodoMVC Example

> React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. Its core principles are declarative code, efficiency, and flexibility. Simply specify what your component looks like and React will keep it up-to-date when the underlying data changes.

See TodoMVC project [here](http://todomvc.com/)

## Prerequisites

You should have both git (https://git-scm.com/downloads) and node (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed in your laptop. We'll use [node (npm)](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm) as our package & dependency manager.

### Windows Installation

Download the Node installer [here](https://nodejs.org/dist/v5.4.0/node-v5.4.0-x64.msi) and run it. This will install `node` and `npm`. See http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows.

## Setup

* Run `npm install`, which installs or **updates** any node packages the project depends on.
* Run `npm run build`, which should build the project and generate `build/bundle.js` and `build/bundle.css`.

## Running

* Run `npm run start`, which starts a local development environment. Open chrome and go to [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)
 * Use `ctrl + c` to stop the server
